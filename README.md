# Fiber::Local

A module to simplify fiber-local state.

[![Development Status](https://github.com/socketry/fiber-local/workflows/Development/badge.svg)](https://github.com/socketry/fiber-local/actions?workflow=Development)

## Features

  - Easily access fiber-local state from a fiber.
  - Default to shared thread-local state.

## Installation

``` bash
$ bundle add fiber-local
```

## Usage

In your own class, e.g. `Logger`:

``` ruby
class Logger
	extend Fiber::Local
	
	def initialize
		@buffer = []
	end
	
	def log(*arguments)
		@buffer << arguments
	end
end
```

Now, instead of instantiating your cache `LOGGER = Logger.new`, use `Logger.instance`. It will return a thread-local instance.

``` ruby
Thread.new do
	Logger.instance
	# => #<Logger:0x000055a14ec6be80>
end

Thread.new do
	Logger.instance
	# => #<Logger:0x000055a14ec597d0>
end
```

In cases where you have job per fiber or request per fiber, you might want to collect all log output for a specific fiber, you can do the following:

``` ruby
Logger.instance
# => #<Logger:0x000055a14ec6be80>

Fiber.new do
	Logger.instance = Logger.new
	# => #<Logger:0x000055a14ec597d0>
end
```
